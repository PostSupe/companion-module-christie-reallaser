# companion-module-christie-reallaser
A Bitfocus Companion Module offering Serial Control over TCP for the latest Christie RGB Laser Projectors

***v0.0.1***
This effort is deeply indebted to the work already done for older projectors in companion-module-christie-projector for which I am very grateful. Per RÃ¸ine's original module is here: https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-christie-projector

Serial Control documentation for the series 3 Laser Projectors are documented here: https://www.christiedigital.com/globalassets/resources/public/020-102714-01-christie-lit-tech-ref-cinelife-v2.2.0.pdf

The initial focus of this module is simple power, shutter/douser, and channel selection to assist with some degree os automation in a room dealing with multiple sources all connected to the same projector/s.

Cheers!
